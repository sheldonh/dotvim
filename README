Designed to work with gnome-terminal set to use a customized version of the
White On Black schema, with Text color set to #E6E1DC and Background color
set to #2B2B2B, and the Tango palette selected.

Once the gnome-terminal changes have been made, I do this to bang copy my
vim config onto a new workstation:

	cd $HOME
	rm -rf .vimrc .vim
	git clone git://github.com/sheldonh/dotvim.git .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	cd .vim
	git submodules sync
	git submodules update

	cd bundle/command-t
	if type -p rvm; then
	  vim=$(which vim)
	  libruby=$(ldd $vim | awk '$1 ~ /libruby/ {print $3}')
	  rubyversion=$(strings $libruby | grep '^1\.[89]\.' | tail -n 1)
	  rvm $rubyversion rake make
	else
	  rake make
	fi

The command-t native extension build is a little tricky.  The version of
Ruby used to build the native extension should match the version of Ruby
against which vim is linked.  On my Fedora 15 workstations, I usually
develop against ruby-1.9.2 using rvm, but the vim-enhanced package is
linked against libruby-1.8.7.
