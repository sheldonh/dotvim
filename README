Designed to work with gnome-terminal set to use a customized version of the
White On Black schema, with Text color set to #E6E1DC and Background color
set to #2B2B2B, and the Tango palette selected.

Once the gnome-terminal changes have been made, I do this to bang copy my
vim config onto a new workstation:

	cd $HOME
	rm -rf .vimrc .vim
	git clone git://github.com/sheldonh/dotvim.git .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	cd .vim
	git submodules sync
	git submodules update
	( cd bundle/command-t && rake make )

The command-t native extension build is a little tricky.  The version of
Ruby used to build the native extension should match the version of Ruby
against which vim is linked.  On a Fedora 15 workstation using the
vim-enhanced package (linked against ruby-1.8.7) with multiple versions
of ruby installed for my user with rvm, I do this to build the extension:

	( cd bundle/command-t && rvm 1.8.7 rake make )
